# python_API_challenge

The weatherPy and vacationPy are finished today 27/01/21.

When running the programs, please noticed to add_in the required api_key, the original keys have been removed for safty reason.

all the required csv and screenshots are supplied.

For the cloudiness at openweathermap api site, there are 4 categories, i.e. 801 = 11-25%, 802 = 25-50%, 803 = 51-84%, 804 = 85-100%, 
however at reality sometime 800 appears. For easy calculation, I assumed 800 = 5%, all others take the average in the range.

Cities leaned finall more than 500.

Beautiful heatmap with more than 500 cities' humidity value presented.

Vacation cities have selected 9 with city/hotel marked on the heatmap.
Hotel name and add, rating with city's name, lat, long are available in hotel.csv/hotel_df  

The API homework is nicely designed with challengs, thanks.

Finally thank you very much for your kindly review and comments.
